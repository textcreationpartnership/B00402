            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:173811:4"/>
            <p>In the meane time, while the Court was full of varietie of di≈øcour≈øe, ≈øome ≈øpeaking out of proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie, others arguing out of de≈øire, what was like to bee the fortune of all, or of any of the≈øe offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours; His Maie≈øtie hauing concluded onely in his owne ≈øecret heart (which is the true oracle of grace and knowledge) in what manner to proceed, (and that without asking coun≈øell of any earthly per≈øon) It plea≈øed him to re≈øolue (betweene God and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe) that their Execution ≈øhould be ≈øtayed, euen at the in≈øtant when the Axe ≈øhould be layde to the Trees rootes. For the ≈øecret and orderly carriage whereof, his Maie≈øtie was carefull to preuent all cau≈øe or colour of ≈øu≈øpicion, of that Iudicious, Royall, and vnexpected cour≈øe which followed. And therefore, after the two Prie≈øts were execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on Tue≈øday the 29. of Nouember, and Ma≈øter <hi>George Brooke</hi> on Munday following, his Maie≈øtie on the ≈øame day, being the fifth of December, ≈øig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned three Warants, for the Execution of the late Lord <hi>Cobham,</hi> L. <hi>Gray,</hi> and Sir <hi>Gryffin Marckham</hi> Knight, with particular direction to the Sheriffe, to performe it on Friday after before ten a clocke in the morning.</p>
            <p>All the≈øe directions being now become noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, both by the Writs of execution (which pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed vnder the great Seale) and by the making rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die the Scaffolds at <hi>Winchester,</hi> His Maie≈øtie very ≈øecretly (as now appeareth by the ≈øequele) drewe him≈øelfe into his Cabinet, on Wedne≈øday before
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:173811:5"/>the day of Execution, and there priuately framed a Warrant written all with his owne hand, to the Sheriffe, by vertue whereof, hee countermaunded all the former directions, alledging the rea≈øons therein mentioned: Of which ≈øeeing no mans Pen can ≈øo well expre≈ø≈øe, as his owne, I ≈øend you the Copie <hi>verbatim,</hi> as I tooke it out of the Originall, which many read in my Cou≈øen Sir <hi>Beniamin Tichbournes</hi> hand.</p>
            <p>And now to come to the ordering of this bu≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe; among many other circum≈øtances, It is very remarkable, with what di≈øcretion and fore≈øight, that per≈øon was elected, which mu≈øt bee v≈øed in carriage of the Warrant. Fir≈øt his Maie≈øtie re≈øol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, it ≈øhould be a Scotti≈øhman, being thereby like to be free≈øt from particular dependancie vpon any Nobleman, Coun≈øellours, or others, their friends or Allyes. Next hee re≈øolued, to ≈øend a man of no extraordinarie ranke, becau≈øe the ≈øtanders by ≈øhould not ob≈øerue any alteration, nor the delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents them≈øelues ≈øhould take any apprehen≈øion of ≈øuch a mans being there at that time: This being his Maie≈øties ≈øpeciall de≈øire, that euery one of them (being ≈øeuerally brought vpon the Scaffold) might quietly breath foorth their la≈øt wordes, and true confe≈ø≈øion of his ≈øecrete≈øt con≈øcience. And ≈øo (to be ≈øhort) his Maie≈øtie made choi≈øe of M. <hi>Iohn Gibb,</hi> a Scotti≈øhman (as afore≈øaid) a man that had neuer dealt with any Coun≈øellor, or other, for ≈øuite or bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øine≈ø≈øe, but one that had (within ≈øhort while after
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:173811:5"/>the Kings fir≈øt entrie) beene ≈øent backe into Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, from whence he was but now fre≈øhly arriued at <hi>Wilton</hi> ≈øome fewe dayes before.</p>
            <p>This party being by the King approoued for an ancient, tru≈øtie, and ≈øecret ≈øeruant (as a Groome of his Maie≈øties bed-chamber) receiuing the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant ≈øecretly on Thur≈øday from the Kings owne hand, &amp; telling his fellowes (who would otherwi≈øe haue mi≈ø≈øed him) that he mu≈øt lie that night at <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisburie</hi> vpon ≈øome priuate bu≈øine≈ø≈øe of his owne, he rode directly to <hi>Winche≈øter,</hi> and there, keeping him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe priuate all night, ro≈øe earely in the morning on Friday, and went ob≈øcurely to the Ca≈øtle greene, where the people flocking in all the morning, as the time drewe neere, hee put him≈øelfe with the throng, clo≈øe by the Scaffold, and there leaned till the Sheriffe brought vp ≈øir <hi>Griffin Markham</hi> to the place, who was the man appointed fir≈øt to die.</p>
            <p>There the ≈øayd Sir <hi>Griffin Markham,</hi> hauing ended his praier, and made him≈øelfe ready to kneele downe, M. <hi>Iohn Gibb</hi> finding it fit time, while the Axe was preparing, to giue ≈øome ≈øecret notice of his charge, called to my co≈øin <hi>Tichborne</hi> the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffe, to ≈øpeake with him, and then deliuered him (priuately) his Maie≈øties warrant, with further di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections verbally, how he ≈øhould v≈øe it.</p>
            <p>Hereupon the Sheriffe perceiuing fully his Maie≈øties intention, ≈øo warily and di≈øcreetly mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhalled the matter, as hee onely called Sir <hi>Griffin Markham</hi> vnto him on the Scaffold, and told him,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:173811:6"/>that he mu≈øt withdraw him≈øelfe into the Hall, to be confronted (before his death) before tho≈øe two Lords, that were to follow him, about ≈øome points that did concerne his Maie≈øties ≈øeruice: and ≈øo ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying <hi>Markham</hi> into the Hall, he left him there, and went vp ha≈øtily for the Lord <hi>Gray</hi> to the Ca≈øtle, who being likewi≈øe brought vp to the Scaffold, and ≈øuffered to powre out his prayers to God (at great length) and to make his la≈øt confe≈ø≈øion, as he would an≈øwere it vpon his ≈øoule, when he was readie to kneele downe, to receiue the ≈øtroke of death, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øter Sheriffe cau≈øed him to ≈øtay, and told him that he mu≈øt goe downe for a while into the Hall, where finding Sir <hi>Griffin Markham,</hi> he willed him to tarry there till he returned.</p>

            <p>The Lord <hi>Cobham</hi> (holding his hand to heauen) applauded this incomparable mercie of ≈øo graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a Soueraigne, aggrauating his owne fault, by comparing it with the Princes clemencie, wi≈øhing confu≈øion to all men aliue, that ≈øhould euer thinke a thought again≈øt ≈øuch a Prince, as neither gaue cau≈øe of offence, nor tooke reuenge of ingratitude.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Gray,</hi> finding in what mea≈øure this rare King had rewarded good for euill, and forborne to make him an example of di≈øcouragement, and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour to all men that hereafter might attempt to breake the bonds of loyalty, vpon the pa≈ø≈øions of any ambition, beganne to ≈øobbe and weepe for a great while, with mo≈øt deepe contrition, prote≈øting now, that ≈øuch was his zeale and de≈øire to redeeme his fault, by any meanes of ≈øatisfaction, as he could ea≈øily ≈øacrifice his life, to preuent the lo≈ø≈øe of one finger of that royall hand, that had dealt ≈øo merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully with him, when he lea≈øt looked for it.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Griffin Marckham</hi> (≈øtanding like a man a≈øto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhed) did nothing but admire and pray. The people that were pre≈øent, witne≈ø≈øed by infinite ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plau≈øe

            <p>The crie being carried out of the Ca≈øtle Gates into the Towne, was not onely ≈øounded with ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation of all ≈øexes, qualities, and affections, but the true report diuulged ≈øince in all partes, hath bred in the woor≈øt di≈øpo≈øed mindes, ≈øuch remor≈øe of iniquitie, in the be≈øt ≈øuch incouragement to loyaltie, and in tho≈øe that are indifferent, ≈øuch feare to offend, and generally ≈øuch affection to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ie≈øties Per≈øon: as per≈øwades the world, that Sathan him≈øelfe can neuer ≈øo farre preuaile with any, as to make them lift vp their hearts or hands again≈øt a Prince, from whom they receiue ≈øo true effects of Iu≈øtice, and goodne≈ø≈øe.</p>
            <p>To conclude therefore, I haue now done my be≈øt, to ≈øatisfie your de≈øire, though I feele (to my griefe) how ≈øhort I come to my owne wi≈øh, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe I would haue expre≈ø≈øed to the life (if it had beene po≈ø≈øible) both the matter and the forme of this proceeding; of both which, the wi≈øe≈øt men, that haue ≈øeene and vnder≈øtoode all particular cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum≈øtances, are at the ende of their wits, to giue an ab≈øolute cen≈øure, whether of them both de≈øerue greater recommendation, (this being mo≈øt a≈ø≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) that there is no Record extant, wherein ≈øo great wi≈øedome and vnder≈øtanding, ≈øo ≈øolid iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ≈øo perfect a re≈øolution, to giue way to no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que≈øt,
